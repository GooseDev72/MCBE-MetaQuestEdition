# MCBE-MetaQuestEdition
# Minecraft officially supports VR (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Pico, etc.) only in PCVR. For bedrock, you need MS Account and Mojang Account (optional, if you are using official launcher) and license for Minecraft. For Vivecraft (a mod) you need pc again. QuestCraft project also needs license. My Minecraft version doesn't need even Internet connection, which is cool. Just sideload this apk file.
